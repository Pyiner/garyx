# Claude Code SDK Notes

- In bidirectional Claude Code SDK sessions, every CLI `control_request` must
  receive a `control_response`, even when the subtype is unsupported or newer
  than this SDK. Dropping one can leave the CLI waiting forever.
- Normal streaming completion should close stdin and wait for the Claude CLI
  process to exit; force-closing the transport can race Claude's local
  transcript flush and break later `--resume` behavior.
- Claude SDK approval tests need a `can_use_tool` callback, which adds
  `--permission-prompt-tool stdio`; changing only `permission_mode` may not
  make Claude send `can_use_tool` requests to the SDK.
- The standalone Claude SDK should preserve Claude Code's built-in system prompt
  by default.
- Pass `--system-prompt` only when Garyx intentionally replaces Claude Code's
  default prompt.
- Use `--append-system-prompt` to keep default tool behavior.
